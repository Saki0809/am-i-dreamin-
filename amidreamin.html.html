        Not done fighting, I don't feel I've lost
        Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
        Got me feeling like it's all too much
        I feel beaten, but I can't give up
        I'm still fighting (Metro), I don't feel I've lost
        Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
        Got me feelin' like it's all too much
        I feel beaten, but I can't give up


        Uh (no way), wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
        Count up my ones, lacin' up my favorite ones
        One of a kind, one of one, the only one
        Got one shot and one chance to take it once
        Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'fore I get the code red
        'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast red
        And swing by four-ten, beef patty, cornbread
        In the concrete jungle, where my home is


        All get focused, all range of toast is
        For nickname, it's the king that do the mostest
        I was livin' down bad in my folk's crib
        Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is
        They want things them folks did or folks get
        We've been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
        My rich friends and my broke friends co-exist
        They love to mix 'em, we know what it is


        Not done fightin' (no way), I don't fear I've lost
        Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
        Got me feeling (no way), like it's all too much
        I feel beaten, but I can't give up
        I'm still fighting (no way), I don't fear I've lost
        Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
        Got me feelin' (no way), like it's all too much
        I feel beaten (no way), but I can't give up


        I can't find it in myself to just walk away
        I can't find it in myself to lose everything
        Feel everyone's against me, don't want me to be great
        Things might look bad, not afraid to look death in the face
        I'm good now, now, now (no way), who's really bad?
        I choose me now, now, now, what's wrong with that?
        Wish you could see me (no way)
        Now, now, hmm, who had my back, baby?


        You don't know no love, always will win
        Not done fightin' (no way) (fightin'), I don't fear I've lost (fear I)
        Am I dreamin' (dreamin'), is there more like us? (More like)
        Got me feeling (no way) (feelin'), like it's all too much
        I feel beaten (beaten), but I can't give up (can't give)
        I'm still fighting (no way), I don't fear I've lost
        Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
        Got me feelin' (no way), like it's all too much


        I feel beaten (no way), but I can't give up
        Can't give up
        Can't give, can't give up
        Can't give, can't give up
        Can't give, can't give up
        Can't give up
